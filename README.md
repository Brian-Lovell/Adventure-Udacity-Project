# Code Review
**Descriptions are printed to the console for the player to see.**

*You are printing the descriptions on the console for the player to see. Nice work here!*

**The time.sleep function is used to create delays between messages so that they aren't all printed at once.**

**The random.choice or random.randint function is used to influence the game so that each game is different in some way.**

*You are using the sleep function to delay printing. Very well!*

*You are using the random.choice Function to select random creatures. Very fine!*

**The input function is used to ask the player what they would like to do.**

**The player's choices affect what happens in the game, including:**

- Whether the player wins or loses
- Whether to restart or exit after the game is over
*The input function is being used correctly to ask the player what he wants to do. Besides, the player's choices affect what happens within the game.*

**If the player enters a choice that is not valid, the game gives them the chance to retry until they enter a valid option.**

**The game does not crash and does not treat invalid input as a valid choice.**

*When the player enters with an option that is not valid, your game is giving the opportunity to repeat until it comes a correct choice. Also, your game is not crashing and is not treating an invalid entry as a valid option.*

**The code includes at least four function definitions that are used to improve the code in some way, such as by:**

- Reducing repetition
- Reducing complexity
- Improving the readability or organization of the code
**Each function should have a single purpose and a name that describes that purpose.**

*You have implemented at least 4 functions that do specific jobs, whose names represent that jobs. Excellent implementation!*

**The pycodestyle tool reports zero errors and zero warnings.**

*The pycodestyle tool did not report errors or warnings. Good job!*
**The program is a playable game, and runs from start to finish without crashing or displaying errors.**

*The game is playable, and you are giving the player a chance to finish or start over.*
